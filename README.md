# ecg_genetics

These are scripts used for training/testing a neural network
to predict atrial fibrilation.

I have written a genetic algorithm to logically tune the
possible neural network hyperparameters.

The process is launched with submit_ga.sh, which then launches
ga_main.py through several generations.
